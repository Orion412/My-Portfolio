                                        <li>I enjoy working with my hands. That work could be vehicle maintenance, playing my guitar, or just typing code. Sharpening my speed and skills are important, and I love to feel the satisfaction that comes with those results.</li>

                          <p>My time in development has only just begun, thanks to <strong><a href="http://thinkful.com" class="links">Thinkful</a></strong>. As a student under their guidance, I'm ready to step into my future career with confidence, understanding, and a mind open to learning more about the industry and the people who help maintain it.</p>

                          <p>If you think I have what it takes to build for you, or if I may be a good fit for your team, let me know! I look foward to hearing from you!</p>
